INCLUDE PROTOBUF WITH YOUR STUFF FFS

I've had a lot of people ask me for my menu and for my source, so I decided that I cba to make it into a little private, so here's the source for you guys.

Don't take credit for what isn't yours.

### To fix errors

#### Windows beep on hitsound:

http://b.reich.io/gjgtnx.wav

Download that, rename it to bame.wav and put it into your sounds folder in the csgo folder. 

#### Loads and loads of errors to do with google/protobuf

:<

#### Configs not working

Make a new directory in C:/ to look like this:

C:/AidanVIP/Configs (they will save to here)
